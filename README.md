## Installation

To run this project, it is recommended to set up a Python virtual environment. This will help you isolate the project's dependencies from your system-wide Python installation. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/CanteenConnect
    ```

3. Create a Python virtual environment (you can replace `venv` with your preferred name):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the Project

Start the Development Server:

To run the Django development server, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
This will start the server, and you can access your Django project at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
